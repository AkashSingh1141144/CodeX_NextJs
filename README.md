## 🚀 Next.js Learning Journey

Welcome to my Next.js Learning Journey repository!
This repo documents my step-by-step learning process of Next.js, a React-based framework for building fast, scalable, and full-stack web applications.

## 🧠 What I’m Learning

In this repository, I’m exploring and practicing the following core Next.js concepts:

## 📁 File-based Routing

⚙️ Server & Client Components

🌐 Data Fetching (SSR, SSG, ISR)

🔄 Dynamic Routing

🧩 API Routes

🧠 Middleware & Authentication

📦 Optimizations & Deployment

Each folder or section represents a different concept or mini-project I built while learning.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
Technology	Purpose
Next.js	Main React framework
TypeScript	Type safety & better DX
Tailwind CSS	Styling & UI design
Aceternity UI	Modern prebuilt UI components
Bun	Fast runtime & package manager

## 🎯 Goal
To master Next.js from fundamentals to advanced level —
building real-world, production-ready web apps with modern tooling.

## 🧩 Future Plans
Build a full-stack project using Next.js + MongoDB
Integrate NextAuth for authentication
Add state management (Redux Toolkit / Zustand)
Deploy projects to Vercel
